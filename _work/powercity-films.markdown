**Brief**

Powercity Films is a full-service video production company specialize in producing authentic, real stories in a cinematic style. Husband and wife duo, Janssen and Mckinzy Powers, work with a great deal of corporate companies and non-profits such as Uber, Amazon, United Nations, and Unicef.


**The Task**

Powercity Films’ hired me to create a brand image that would allow them to pitch their company to enterprise clients and agencies. 

My goal was to create a seamless and memorable brand experience as well as a platform to showcase all of Powercity Films’ work in one place.

**Creating the Website**

Powercity Films needed a place to showcase all of their work in a modern, professional manner. They didn’t want to lose the attention of potential clients, so I designed a single scrolling page to keep users in one place.

First impressions are everything, so I designed their website as a single scrolling page, presenting who they are, what they do, and how to contact them all in one consistent user experience.

**The Results**

“We can now confidently collaborate with agencies and brands with consistent image creating a stronger following and fanbase.”
