  \*\*Creating the Website\*\*

  Powercity Films needed a place to showcase all of their work in a modern, professional manner. They didn’t want to lose the attention of potential clients, so I designed a single scrolling page to keep users in one place.

  First impressions are everything, so I designed their website as a single scrolling page, presenting who they are, what they do, and how to contact them all in one consistent user experience.
