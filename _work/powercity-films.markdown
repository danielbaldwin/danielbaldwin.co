**Designing an identity for a film company**

Powercity Films is a full-service video production company specializing in producing authentic, real stories in a cinematic style. Husband and wife duo, Janssen and Mckinzy Powers, work with a great deal of corporate companies and non-profits such as Uber, Amazon, United Nations, and Unicef.

Director Janssen Powers came to me looking for help with building their brand identity and designing a website to help them grow their clientele.

Their goal was to create a brand image that would allow them to pitch their company to enterprise clients and agencies.

**Introducing Powercityfilms.com**

Powercity Films needed a place to showcase all of their work in a modern, professional manner. They didnâ€™t want to lose the attention of potential clients, so I designed a single scrolling page to keep users in one place.

First impressions are everything, so I designed their website as a single scrolling page, presenting who they are, what they do, and how to contact them all in one consistent user experience.

This project was completed in August 2015. For specific questions or to work together on a future project, shoot me an email at [hello@danielbaldwin.co](mailto:hello@danielbaldwin.co).
