**Rebranding an agency**

In 2015, I led Twelve23’s rebranding effort and ultimately turned an IT service into a creative agency. At the time, Twelve23’s services ranged from consulting to small development projects and the duration of each new project lasted only a few weeks.

After being hired as an in-house designer, I quickly strategized with the founder to see how I could extend Twelve23’s reach, bring in a new client demographic, and bring in a wider range of projects.

I helped Twelve23 gear their services towards each team member’s individual strengths and collectively form a creative agency. 

**Refreshing Twelve23’s Identity**

After coming up with a gameplan, it was time to refresh Twelve23’s visual identity. I started with its logo. At its core, Twelve23 was known for bringing new, innovative solutions to each of their clients. I designed the logo to visualize this concept, providing an illustrative approach to the “out-of-the-box” concept.

**Creating a Facade**

Twelve23 knew the direction that it wanted to go, however, its previous work did not quite put them in the spot they needed to be to start attracting new clients. I helped them break down each of their projects and find areas that could be elaborated on or stretched.

**The Final Product**

Twelve23’s new website and identity attracted an entirely new demographic of clients. Their future work ranged from boutique brick-and-mortar shops to mobile apps for startups.
