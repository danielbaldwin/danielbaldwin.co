**Brief**

TINT is a content aggregation platform that allows brands to pull user-generated content from multiple sources across the web and showcase it at every marketing experience. 

In May 2016, TINT repositioned from being a social media display tool to an all-inclusive community content platform. I was tasked with taking TINT’s new positioning and turning it into a brand identity.

My challenge was to create a brand identity that would meet current needs and also carry the business into the future.

I crafted a 76-page brand book for TINT that serves as a communication & identity style guide.

**Increasing Conversions**

One challenge TINT was facing was numbers. With over 60,000 users visiting TINT’s website each month, only 2.5% were clicking the Free Trial CTA. An even smaller group of users were clicking Request a Demo — 0.5%. 

My challenge was to create a new homepage that aligned TINT’s positioning with its newfound brand identity. I focused on creating a homepage that would direct users to TINT’s educational resources (blog, case studies, etc.) before trying to convert them.

By rethinking and redesigning TINT’s homepage, TINT experienced a 148% increase in click-throughs to the trial sign up page and a 540% increase in click-throughs to the demo request page.
