  **Building the Brand**

  A brand is only as successful as the people carrying it’s name forward. As TINT’s team expanded across multiple regions, it was important to create unity with the brand.

  My challenge was to create a brand identity that would meet current needs and also carry the business into the future.

  I crafted a 76-page brand book for TINT that serves as a communication & identity style guide.

Third Paragraph Text: "**Increasing Conversions**\n\nOne challenge TINT was facing
  was numbers. With over 60,000 users visiting TINT’s website each month, only 2.5%
  were clicking the Free Trial CTA. An even smaller group of users were clicking Request
  a Demo — 0.5%. \n\nMy challenge was to create a new homepage that aligned TINT’s
  positioning with its newfound brand identity. I focused on creating a homepage that
  would direct users to TINT’s educational resources (blog, case studies, etc.) before
  trying to convert them.\n\nBy rethinking and redesigning TINT’s homepage, TINT experienced
  a 148% increase in click-throughs to the trial sign up page and a 540% increase
  in click-throughs to the demo request page."

**Brief**

TINT is a content aggregation platform that allows brands to pull user-generated content from multiple sources across the web and showcase it at every marketing experience. 

In May 2016, TINT repositioned from being a social media display tool to an all-inclusive community content platform. I was tasked with taking TINT’s new positioning and turning it into a brand identity.
