**Humanizing a SaaS Product**

​​TINT is a content aggregation platform that allows brands to pull user-generated content from multiple sources across the web and showcase it at every marketing experience. 
​​
​​In May 2016, TINT repositioned from being a social media display tool to an all-inclusive community content platform. I was tasked with taking TINT’s new positioning and turning it into a brand identity.
​​
​​My challenge was to create a brand identity that would meet current needs and also carry the business into the future.
​​
​​I crafted a 76-page brand book for TINT that serves as a communication & identity style guide.
