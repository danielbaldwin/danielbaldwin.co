**Illustrations for a driving app website**

​​I was approached by Drivemode’s design team to help with their website refresh. Working closely with their designers, my role was to create a set of illustrations that would be used across their website and other marketing collateral. 
​​
​​At the time, Drivemode was announcing their Series A fundraising, raising $6.5 million from Panasonic among other investors. With features in the media (TechCrunch, Engadget, and Business Insider to name a few), Drivemode.com had a lot of eyes on their redesigned site. 

In addition to designing 24 illustrations, I helped Drivemode evolve their designs to a more sophisticated illustration style in order to target an older demographic.

This project was completed in March 2017. For specific questions or to work together on a future project, shoot me an email at [hello@danielbaldwin.co](mailto:hello@danielbaldwin.co).
