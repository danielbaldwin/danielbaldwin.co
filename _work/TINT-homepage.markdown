TINT is a content aggregation platform that allows brands to pull user-generated content from multiple sources across the web and showcase it at every marketing experience.

My challenge was to create a new homepage that aligned TINT’s positioning with its newfound brand identity. The goal was to educate users about the benefits of user-generated content and in return increase conversions. 

With over 60,000 users visiting TINT’s website each month, only 2.5% were clicking the Free Trial CTA. An even smaller group of users were clicking Request a Demo — 0.5%.

By rethinking and redesigning TINT’s homepage, TINT experienced a 148% increase in click-throughs to the trial sign up page and a 540% increase in click-throughs to the demo request page.
