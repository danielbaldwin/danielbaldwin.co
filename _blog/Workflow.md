For those of us working on small design teams, we know what it’s like to have projects with fast turnaround times. [Optimizing your workflow is imperative to becoming a successful designer.](http://ctt.ec/0H0Qm) <i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i> Luckily, there are hundreds of tools available that will help you do just that. The following apps have helped me structure my daily routine, improve the quality of my work, and increase my productivity:

**[Hours:](https://www.hourstimetracking.com/)**  This app is almost always open in my web browser. For being such a simple time-tracking tool, it has changed my freelancing game completely:

1. I’ve gained insight into my daily productivity patterns, which led me to plan my work schedule more effectively.

2. I can visually see when I’ve put in too many hours on a project (as well as not enough), helping me discover a better work-life balance.

3. I was able to adjust my rates based off of the average time it takes for me to finish a project.

**[Sketch:](http://sketchapp.com/)**  Nike vs. Adidas… Canon vs. Nikon... Photoshop vs. Sketch. I made the switch from Creative Cloud to Sketch a few months ago, and it has streamlined my design workflow significantly. Everything just seems easier with Sketch, from designing across multiple artboards to exporting assets in bulk.

**[Invision:](http://invisionapp.com/)**  Gone are the days where sending clients zip files full of “date_projectName_clientName_revision26.pdf” and “READ ME FIRST!” are acceptable. Invision allows you to:

1. Turn your mockups into clickable, interactive prototypes

2. Annotate and converse with clients and collaborators directly within your designs

3. Launch meetings and walk your clients through your designs remotely

**[Zeplin:](http://invisionapp.com/)**  Handing off projects to developers can be a headache, but Zeplin helps speed up and alleviate the process. After designing in Sketch and collaborating in Invision, I’m ready to turn my designs into code. Zeplin automatically extracts styles from your files and creates a style guide, allows you to extract assets directly from the app, and generates measurements (padding, line height, width, etc.) that help you develop a pixel perfect design.

**[Seplice:](http://semplicelabs.com/)**  Semplice is a portfolio system based on Wordpress, built by designers, for designers. I discovered it recently through one of [Tobias van Schneider](https://twitter.com/vanschneider)’s tweets, and quickly fell in love. Semplice has allowed me to spend less time building a portfolio and more time adding content to it.

**[Lookback:](http://lookback.io/)**  Understand where you can, and where you need to improve design. Using Lookback, you can record user sessions to follow user journeys, as well as watch recorded bug reports to see areas where your design isn’t working as expected.

**[Grammarly:](https://medium.com/@danielbaldwin_/www.grammarly.com)**  Everybody’s been there… you get button-crazy and push send before proofreading an email, only to find out that you accidentally sent it with several typos. Grammarly not only highlights spelling errors, but it also corrects your grammar as you type. This tool has saved me many times. Even though it isn’t exactly a design tool, it has become a staple amongst my bookmarks bar.

**[Paper:](https://paper.dropbox.com/)**  Dropbox Paper is one of my favorite all-in-one tools. I use it in the beginning stages of a project when interviewing a client to understand their needs. I also use it to collaborate on copy. And at the end of the day, I use it to log my progress. Their minimal interface allows you to focus on what it’s meant for — writing.

**[Sunrise:](http://www.sunrise.am/)**  This is the simplest (and cleanest) calendar I’ve ever used. It syncs all of your calendars and allows you to see a weekly (or monthly) overview of what’s ahead. The greatest feature is [Meet](https://sunrise.am/meet/), an iOS and Android keyboard, that lets you see your calendar and book meetings without leaving your messaging app.

**[Buffer:](http://www.buffer.com/)**  A member of the marketing team I work with at TINT introduced me to Buffer, and it has helped me keep up on my social media. It’s one of those “set and forget” kind of apps, especially when synced with your Pocket favorites through [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/recipes/70559-pocket-favorite-to-buffer).
